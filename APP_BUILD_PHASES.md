## Key Project Information

### Project Details
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **App Name** | FamilyHub |
| **Bundle ID** | com.lawsonsenterprises.familyhub |
| **Organization** | Lawsons Enterprises Ltd |
| **Developer** | Andy Lawson, London, UK |
| **Platform** | iOS 17.0+ |
| **Design System** | Liquid Glass (Apple 2025) |
| **Language** | British English throughout |

### Users

- **Rachel** - Mum (parent, family overview)
- **Andy** - Dad (parent, family overview)

### Current App State

**What Works ✅**
- User creation and selection
- Tab navigation (Today, Timetable, Settings)
- Settings screen with user profile
- Light/dark mode switching
- Liquid Glass design rendering
- Navigation between views

**What's Empty (Expected) 📋**
- Today view (no timetable data yet - Phase 2)
- Timetable view (no PDF imported yet - Phase 2)
- Notifications settings (v2.0+ feature)
- Week Configuration (Phase 2 feature)

**What's Missing (To Add) ⚠️**
- Switch User functionality
- Multiple test users
- Debug logging cleanup

## Critical Decisions (from DECISIONS.md)

### Architecture
- **MVVM with SwiftUI** - Standard iOS pattern, modular design
- **Button-based tap** - More reliable than onTapGesture
- **SwiftData + iCloud** - Local-first with automatic sync

### Key Product Decisions
- **PDF Permissions (Option C)** - Any family member can import/manage any student's timetable
- **Authentication (Path A)** - Ship MVP first (Phase 1-3), then add Apple ID (Phase 4)
- **Profile Photos** - Deferred to v1.1+ (after MVP)
- **HealthKit** - Phase 5 feature (fitness app prep)

### Scope
- **In Scope:** Timetable tracking, Week A/B, multi-user, iCloud sync
- **Out of Scope:** Backend, multi-family support, complex auth (until Phase 4)
- **Future:** Sign in with Apple (Phase 4), HealthKit (Phase 5)

## Phase 1.2 Implementation Notes

### Switch User Button Implementation

**Approach:** Add @Binding to views to pass selectedUser state down

**Required Changes:**
1. **ContentView.swift** - Already has `@State private var selectedUser: User?`
2. **MainTabView.swift** - Add `@Binding var selectedUser: User?` parameter
3. **SettingsView.swift** - Add `@Binding var selectedUser: User?` parameter
4. **Switch User action** - Set `selectedUser = nil` to return to UserSelectionView

**Code Pattern:**
```swift
// In SettingsView
Section {
    Button {
        selectedUser = nil // This returns to UserSelectionView
        HapticManager.light()
    } label: {
        Label("Switch User", systemImage: "arrow.left.arrow.right")
    }
}
```

### Debug Logging Cleanup

**Files with print statements:**
- `ContentView.swift` (lines 19, 23, 26, 29)
- `UserSelectionView.swift` (lines 21, 39-41, 96-97, 100-101)

**Search patterns to remove:**
- `print("📱`
- `print("👥`
- `print("🔵`
- `print("🟠`
- `print("🟢`
- `print("🟡`
- `let _ = print(`
